 Exploring how OpenWeatherMap API works.
 
 This application is created with Vanilla Javascript and uses https://openweathermap.org/current API to get the current weather data, using   user's current longitude and latitude as its coordinates.

To prevent errors from accessing the API locally, cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com is used as a proxy.
